#Dusty Angels: The story behind the human cost of cocaine.

###Why White Paradise?
The idea for this infographic was born from a conversation about how much stigma there is around being a Colombian. There is a widely held misconception that all Colombians are cocaine users and an intentional part of the drug trade.
In reality, not only is this undeserved, but Colombia has been ravaged by war and violence and set off balance by drug money. We wanted create a visualization of the direct relationship between drug production and human displacement, homicide, and war.
We want to show the world that Colombians are victims of the cocaine market.
